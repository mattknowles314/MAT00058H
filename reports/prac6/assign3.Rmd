## Principal Component Analysis

We begin by loading the data in the standard way. Note how I have chosen to use headers when loading the coffee information file as they column labels are human-readable, whereas the coffee data column headers aren't and would result in extra clutter, so it makes sense just to label them as V1,V2,... etc.

```{r}
  coffeeData <- read.table("/home/matthew/Documents/University/PDS/Datasets/coffee-origin.txt")
  coffeeInfo <- read.table("/home/matthew/Documents/University/PDS/Datasets/origin-info.txt", header = T)
```

Now we move onto the PCA itself.

```{r}
  coffeePCA <- prcomp(coffeeData, scale =T)
  biplot(coffeePCA)
```
